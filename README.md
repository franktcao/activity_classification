# Bitcoin Prediction through Classification

**Hypothesis** : Is there a way to use data science to leverage the predictability of Bitcoin Pricing?
**Problem Statement**: High Frequency Trading often uses machine learning algorithms to track pricing of assets that are part of the largest index funds. The complexities that come from pricing certain assets is figuring out the right model to track several different features that can help in the long-term predictability of assets. Since Bitcoin is new to the trading world and instead of investing in company’s growth, we are looking at the changes in prices of crypto currencies.

**Motivation**: The interesting part of this new market is Bitcoin’s blockchain accounting system. This automated accounting ledger does all of the timestamp tracking of buying and selling of the many trades that occur in cryptocurrencies.  This makes crypto-currencies an unknown territory to predictability. The goal of this project will be to test different machine learning methodologies that can influence the accuracy rate and reduce the error rate of upcoming prices within short time intervals. This can range from open and close frequency to weekly patterns over the lifetime of the coin.
